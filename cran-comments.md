This is a data package, previously part of the AMR package and now split into two different packages, as suggested by CRAN maintainers. The only exported function it contains is to return details on recency of the data, including its sources.

As soon as this package is on CRAN, the AMR package will be resubmitted as well, with a much lower file size and a dependency on this package.
